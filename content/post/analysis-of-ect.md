I learned about ECT this year in psychology, and I have a few comments regarding the related ethics and science.

When I first heard of ECT, I had a pretty immediate feeling that something about it did not stir well with me. According to the Mayo Clinic, this procedure"done under general anesthesia, in which small electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure" (par 1). 

 Apparently, the data suggests that it's safe and effective, and works quickly for treatment resistant depression. That seems like good news, right? Looking at a few meta analyses and articles and first hand experiences illustrated to me that perhaps this isn't the panacea we were searching for. 

I think we need to find another solution, one that is more sustainable and has *long term health* in mind. These days, I feel like everyone rushes, but this kind of shortcut can have a long term, detrimental result. For highly suicidal patients, a quick solution seems wonderful, but if it has a high relapse rate and requires maintenance  treatments every month, I'm not sure how great that is long term. Honestly, I think watching an unstable patient in a hospital setting and finding safer treatments will yield better results than a quick fix that seems that it causes lasting harm. 

One major red flag that I have with this treatment is that it involves a controlled seizure.  There have been multiple studies that illuminate patients developing epilepsy, even without a prior history or disposition to that condition. That's not very good. When you have seizures, your brain, an electrically connected mass of complex structures, signals it has a problem. 

In 2016, a PubMed case [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.13565/full) by Alexander Bryson from the Department of Neurology, Austin Health and his colleagues reports that "five patients who received maintenance ECT and developed florid temporal epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography (EEG) despite no history of epilepsy and normal neuroimaging. All patients had received regular ECT for at least 8 months." The sample size is quite small, but 5 people developing epilepsy when they lacked history of it seems to be a concerning number. The ages ranged from 31 to 81 and were distributed pretty evenly along that range, which suggests that this can occur within any age group. I recommend reading this interesting, though a bit disturbing article. 

Additionally, the symptoms seems suspiciously close to a concussion, and there have been a wealth of studies that support the notion that *those* are dangerous.
