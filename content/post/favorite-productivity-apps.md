**Passwords**

* [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)- I currently recommend this one. Free & Open Source

* iCloud Keychain - magic for apple devices, currently using this one.

* * Alternatives: Lastpass, Keepass ( using currently), 1Password (haven’t used, have heard good reviews)

**Organization** - You can do this with note taking apps, but these do have slightly different approaches.

* [airtable-](https://airtable.com) amazing program that allows you to make relational databases /spread sheets that can be viewed in several different ways(including kanban). You can add rich content as well. Honestly amazing

* Folders & Files - also using this to some extent. I tag my files and it's working pretty okay.

* [trello](https://trello.com/)- utilizes rich, sharable boards for to-do/projects/etc. I sort of want to use it, but it hasn't clicked for me yet.

* [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) - can be great for lists and saving resources, good exploration options. Can be a bit hard to navigate over time, if you don't clean your boards/tag. (happened to me)

* [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/)/ [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/read/925426689)- useful for organizing things you wish to refer to in the future. I have an If This Then That applet set up to sync between these two. Instapaper looks prettier to read in, sometimes.

* **[Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org)** - an extension of emacs, a programming text editor. Currently use this for some outlines (you can fold them and it's very nice), but I find the learning curve pretty high (not your usual app). People do a lot of neat things with it though, so I may return to it one day.

* Eventually will try: devonTHINK

**To Do / Planning**

* [Plan ](http://getplan.co) - amazing app that allows you to write up tasks, then drag them into a calendar to schedule them. Also supports kanban boards. Currently using this combined with Airtable

* [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) / [wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) recommended To-Do list apps. I like plan.co enough that I don't use another todo list app. It's helpful to consolidate services if you can.

**Note Taking**

* [Typora ](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.typora.io&t=NWVhOTU1NDI5Y2E5NDIwYmViMjdjNGUwYjliOGE1N2QxM2EwZjliZSxBWXBMdGpadA%3D%3D&b=t%3AgNrt7AayYkimRbElvYpsXg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fthoughtseek.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161638029252%2Fthoughtseeks-note-taking-organization-programs&m=1)- beautiful markdown editor with inline styling. Free in beta (Windows/Mac/Linux). I adore this app. Minimal, clean, many functions that stay out of your way.

* [Treesheets](http://strlen.com/treesheets/) - free open source program that is “ ultimate replacement for spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMS, text editors, and small databases” I *love* this program for organizing. I’ve tried a ton of things so far, but this is so flexible and well designed, though there is a bit of a learning curve. I’m a really visual person, so emacs orgmode isn’t really for me, but this is

* [dynalist](https://dynalist.io/)// [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/)- really neat expanding outline/notes program. Free!

* [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app-for-notes-and-prose/id1016366447?mt=8&at=1000luo9) - nice markdown support, aesthetic, light, very cheap subscription based price model

* [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) - plain text, free, light, minimal

* [GoogleKeep](https://keep.google.com/) - aesthetic, simple.

* [Breakdown Notes](https://www.breakdown-notes.com) - pretty neat, allows you to create notes, diagrams, maps.

* [Microsoft OneNote ](https://www.onenote.com/)- very full featured, great pen/annotation options. Only thing annoying is that the add text anywhere to the page can lead to overlapping mess of notes.

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) - comparable to OneNote

* [Bullet Journal - The Analog System for the Digital Age](http://bulletjournal.com/) - also falls under organization.

* [Anki](https://ankiweb.net)- For academic notes, active recall is honestly better than just rereading/writing notes forever. (though physically writing things down *is* very useful)  So I recommend taking notes in a quizzable way and using

**Mindmapping**

This category falls under notetaking & organization to some extent, but is pretty unique, so I am separating it. Mindmaps are pretty cool, though they can get a little messy if you don't organize them.

* [xmind](http://www.xmind.net) - paid for pro version, but the free one is functional and you can turn outlines into mindmaps (love this)

* [freeplane](http://www.freeplane.org/wiki/) - a fork of the open source project freemind, a bit more aesthetic and nice.

* [mindnode](https://mindnode.com) - recommended, paid. Mac.

**To Try **

* [paperwork](http://paperwork.rocks/) - open source/free

* [Elphant](http://elephant.mine.nu/) - open source/free

* [Laverna](https://laverna.cc/)

* [Ulysses](https://www.ulyssesapp.com/) - $ but known for being worth it, markdown, great organization options, aesthetic. I really want to try this & Scrivener

* [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) -$ but known for being worth it, good for complex projects like research papers and novels, some learning curve

* [Tagspaces](http://tagspaces.org/)

* [Rowstack](http://rowstack.com/) - project management for teams, but obviously can be used by one person as well!

* emacs / vim - high learning curve, but known to be greatgreat

* [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver) - for programmers, but could be applied to everyone

[YCominator Open Source Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9206002) - enter the rabbit hole!
