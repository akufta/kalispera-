<span style="color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-size: 1rem;">I love meditation. Over time, regular practice has reduced stress (summer helps as well!) and worry and increased focus and mental resilience.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">What's nice about meditation is that it's easy to pick up. You only need to sit down, set a timer, and focus. There are&nbsp;</span>several<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;ways to meditate, but I find the most useful for me personally is to just observe your thoughts–not trying to push them away or follow them. It makes it less stressful than trying to forcibly clear your mind, which for me, often fails and has me thinking about what I was trying not to think about even harder!</span>

Sometimes, it's hard to remember to meditate. Using an app helps with that, even though phones are often anti-calming/super distracting. However, as a tool, they can be very useful for building up a meditation practice.

I've tried a lot of apps, and my favorite is **[insight timer](https://insighttimer.com).**

[Free download for [ [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zen-timer-meditation-timer/id337472899?mt=8) | [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotlightsix.zentimerlite2) ]

This app has many features, but also manages to be simple and streamlined, as to not get in your way.

**My favorite features: **

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">clean &amp; uncluttered interface</span>

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">graphs &amp; analytics - these are so neat to have! With a mood tracker, you can analyze the effects of meditation to see if it helps you over time or not, or if it does, to what extent.&nbsp;</span>

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">reminders - I aim for twice a day, but I sometimes I do once a day, and that's okay.&nbsp;</span>

* great export options  - your data is yours!

* journal prompt after meditation - I used to use this, but I don't really anymore. I now journal / log my mood in [moodnotes](http://moodnotes.thriveport.com), which I will probably write a review of in the future.

* free, no subscription for core features. You can support the devs by buying extra sounds though! I definitely will in the future.

* For now, I use no bell (I do use the rain background noise!) and let my meditations go as long as I feel. Usually 1-3 minutes, though I will probably try to increase that amount in the future.

* View stats on the web interface

**Other cool features** ( I don't really use these that much, but they're really nice to have)

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">communities</span>

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">guided meditations - nice amount of user generated meditations</span>
