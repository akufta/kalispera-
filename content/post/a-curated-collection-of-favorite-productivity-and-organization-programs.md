A curated collection of useful productivity tools and programs. As I was freaking out in college, I  experimented a bit, and here are my current recommendations.

I love paper, but I also love trees and the environment. I try to save paper when I can, and sometimes that means leaving the mess (that looks like my mind) of scattered reams of paper behind. Technology, though it of course has its faults and can seem like the antithesis of productivity, has helped me figure out how to organize myself and experiment until I found a system for me.

Honestly, when I start a new journal/planner in paper, I always am nervous and partially disturbed when I mark up a new page. (Since pen also looks better for paper planning, I use them but it ups the stress level a bit as well. I'm usually seen with whiteout handy)

I love trying out new apps and programs, and am still trying to decide which system works for me. I am getting a new computer mid-May and will be thoroughly reviewing some of these apps and trying out new ones. Feel free to message me with your favorites!

## My Current Favorite Productivity Tools and  Set Up

I am a busy college student and love to write and create in my freetime. This means I need to stay organized and manage my time effectively.

Here is my current set up:

**Habit tracking** in my panda notebook my amazing homie got me for my birthday. It helps me look at what I need to do and want to do without opening up my phone and being bombardded with notifications I will most likely ignore anyways. It also keeps me accountable!

**Health** is tracked in the [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/) app. Exercise makes you a lot more productive and physically and mentally healthier, which is why I included it in this roundup. I am considering a Garmin watch once I am able to start working towards more intensive races like the half and full marathons. Sometimes if I want to decide when to set my alarm, I use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me), a website, that counts for you and recommends times to wake up that are at the end of your sleep cycles. It helps you wake up less groggy and confused. I also meditate and keep track of it with the help of [InsightTimer](https://insighttimer.com/), which is free and has a lot of neat options. Does not require a subscription.

**Task management** is done in [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/). I jumped around a million different apps, but I think I will stick to this one. I keep my setup pretty simple, because if you make the task management unmanageable, you get overwhelmed with an illusion of being organized. Also you end up spending more time planning than just getting the tasks done!

**Podoromo timing** is a great way to ease yourself into work or any other activity that requires focus and no distractions. You do not even need an app, just a timer for 25 minutes (or whatever interval you choose). Once that's over, take a 5 min break, and start again. If you are lucky, eventually, you won't need the timer because you settle into a good flow.

**Academic note taking**

* Lectures: paper notebook and pen, since this is what allows me to be engaged and what is allowed in every single class.
* After lecture, usually the same day: I transfer my notes and turn them into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards. This program allows you take take advantage of spaced repetition, which is a god send. Also it's open source and customizable, though a bit harder to use at first than quizlet.  I use [plugin](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/544521385) that allows me to skip the scheduling and use them like a normal online flashcard deck. This program takes a bit of time to set up, but is powerful and you do not need to pay for features like quizlet. Though I will donate to them once I grow up, get a good job, and have money to spare.
  * This set up is worth it because the human brain remembers things it has to be forced to recall. Recognition is not the same thing as recall. This is why I do not spend time rewriting my notes, unless it's a topic I keep getting forgetting or cannot I answer a related question correctly.

**General note taking** - I actually tend to just send a bunch of my favorite articles to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) or visual things to [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com). If there are key take aways, I tend to write an article/note on them. I mainly write about art resources and tutorials, as well as creative marketing and stuff like that on another website. I made. It helps lock in the info. Teaching and applying are really effective ways to learn and retain things. I am also looking into [XMind](http://xmind.net) for organizing some of my thoughts, and for writing articles.

**Writing and coding** - I love writing both creative and nonfiction material. For creative work, I am using [**Scrivener**](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview)  and [**Typora** ](https://typora.io), though I primarily use [**Typora** ](https://typora.io) for writing articles. Scrivener has a lot of super neat organizational features and good for researching. Once the free trial expires, I will be happy to pay  and  support a small, awesome software company like Literature and Latte. For coding, I use the lovely [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's fast, flexible, and I use it every day to modify this website's code. I primarily make CSS and HTML changes, and customize JS and the Go template.

Note: Programs in bold are other programs I  am currently or am experimenting with, I do love to experiment and often try new workflows, though. Let me know if you use any of these?

## Project Management & Organization

Possible with note taking apps and others, but these apps are specifically targetted for project management and organization.

* [**Airtable**](http://airtable.com)**-** amazing program that allows you to make relational databases /spread sheets that can be viewed in several different ways, including kanban boards ala Trello. You can add rich content as well. It's a cool app.
* [**Zenkit**](https://zenkit.com/) - has a few more views than Airtable, and I really like it. I especially like the table view and the fact that you can adapt this app for a lot of different things.
* [Trello](https://trello.com/)- utilizes rich, sharable boards for to-do/projects/etc. A very popular option. I used to use it, but I am experimenting with others for now.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - combines a lot of apps, docs, wikis, and tasks. Very flexible app. Enjoyed it when I tried it out. I might reintegrate it into my workflow or switch back to it one day.

## To Do, Task Management, and Planning

* [**Todoist**](https://en.todoist.com/) - Extremely popular app, and for a good reason.. It's really flexible and has tons of integrations with other services without being overwhelming and requiring too much set up, as I have experienced with some other apps. There's a lot of resources and tutorials. I love the clean interface and the many features it provides. It's also easy to hunt around on the internet for codes for 3 month premium subscriptions.
  * Currently using this one! Here's a [detailed review by PCmag](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2408574,00.asp) and a [list of shorter reviews](https://en.todoist.com/reviews).
* [**Plan**](https://getplan.co/)  - amazing app that allows you to write up tasks, then drag them into a calendar to schedule them. Also supports kanban boards. It's a bit rough around the edges at times, but is consistently updated and really nice. ​
* [**Google calendar**](https://www.google.com/calendar)**-** there are others like Apple’s built in calendar, TimePage by Moleskine, etc. I use this, along with my apple calendars, with other apps. It integrates nicely with those.
  * I am using **Fantastical 2** on [Mac](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2/id975937182?mt=12&at=1001ly2n) & [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-ipad/id830708155?mt=8&at=1001ly2n) - pricey, but worth it. I got them on sale, so it wasn't overly expensive.

## Note Taking

* [**Typora** ](https://typora.io)- beautiful markdown editor with inline styling. Free in beta (Windows/Mac/Linux). Currently using this great program for typing up my posts. It's clean and updated pretty regularly.
* [**Scrivener**](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview)  -the folks at Literature and Latte just released version 3 and it's _beautiful_. Currently trying it out, and plan to buy it once my free trial is over. A beautifully designed program that can be customized and adapted to a lot of different workflows. Highly capable for complex writing.
* [**XMind**](http://xmind.net) - free and awesome mind mapping tool. I am trying to figure out how to implement this more into my note taking / organization. I like that you can use it in an outline view, which is helpful. Also the UI is quite aesthetically pleasing.
* [Treesheets](http://strlen.com/treesheets/)  - free open source program that is “ ultimate replacement for spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMS, text editors, and small databases”. This is a neat  program for organizing, though it is slightly buggy and has a retro UI. It's flexible and well designed and better for me as a visual person than something like emacs' orgmode.
* If you are an outline person:
  * check out [dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) and [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/). They both let you make crazy outlines that can be collapsed and zoomed in.
  * If you are technically advanced, try out [Emacs OrgMode](http://orgmode.org/) which is free and open source, and allows you to create outlines but also do so much more. Check out that huge feature list. High learning curve. I tried it, and I do like it, but I prefer more visual tools that require less set up and configuration.
  * [Outline Edit](https://outlineedit.com/) for Mac is a nicely designed outline program that is free.
* [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) -  aesthetic and allows you to use Markdown in a more visual way, light, very cheap subscription based price model.
* [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) - plain text, free, light and clean, minimal.
* [GoogleKeep](http://keep.google.com) - aesthetic, simple.
* [**Microsoft OneNote**](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onenote.com%2F&t=YTk0NWI5NDhhZjI3ZmM1ZDBjMWZiMzg3MmQ5ZDllMmNlZjFhZDkyYSxBWXBMdGpadA%3D%3D&b=t%3AgNrt7AayYkimRbElvYpsXg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fthoughtseek.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161638029252%2Fthoughtseeks-note-taking-organization-programs&m=1) **-** very full featured, great pen/annotation options. I use this once in a while to draw diagrams.
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) - comparable to OneNote. Allows you to collect and organize as well.
* [Bullet Journal - The Analog System for the Digital Age](http://bulletjournal.com/) -I use a notebook to track my habits only, but this is a popular and awesome option to organize your life on paper. Also falls under organization
* For academic notes, active recall is honestly better than just rereading/writing notes forever. (though physically writing things down _is_ very useful)  So I recommend taking notes in a quizzable way and using
* 
  * \*\*[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) \*\*- powerful, intelligent flashcards or [quizlet](https://quizlet.com)

## Bookmarks and Knowledge Curation

* [pinterest](http://pinterest.com)  - can be great for lists and saving resources, good exploration options.
* [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) / Instapaper- useful for organizing things you wish to refer to in the future. I have an If This Then That applet set up to sync between these two. Instapaper looks prettier to read in, sometimes.
* [Kozmos](https://getkozmos.com) - a new, indie app for bookmarking that is lovely. Simple and fast. Still in beta, but I like it. I import my Pocket articles in here occasionally. In private beta, so watch for it or just request an invite!

## Passwords

* [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - Sort of using this and iCloud Keychain, which is awesome. Bitwarden is free & open source
* 
  * Alternatives: Lastpass, Keepass ( using currently), 1Password (haven’t used, have heard good reviews)

## Automation

* [**IFTTT**](https://ifttt.com/) - a cool app that allows you to link other apps and services together, saving time. I use this for a few things! Lots of public recipes out there.
* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) - very popular automation tool. Allows you to perform more complex links than IFTTT for certain usecases.
  * Going to try this: [Bip](https://www.bip.io) - open source. Seems a bit harder to use.

## List of other apps I may try one day

* [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/) - $ but known for being worth it, markdown, great organization options, aesthetic.
* [Tagspaces](http://tagspaces.org/)  - a really interesting looking app.
* Vim - high learning curve, but great
* [http://happenapps.com/#quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver) - for programmers, but could be applied to everyone
