Hi there! Thank you for visiting! 

I am a writer and artist that enjoys thinking, deep conversations, running, and drinking coffee with my homies. I'm passionate about social issues, protecting the environment, and learning. Here, I plan to share some tips on productivity, thoughts about several topicsâ€“including science, art, and society, and record updates on my art projects. 

The name Kalispera comes from the Greek phrase, good evening, and I thought matched the vibe I am going for.

Feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:allisonkufta@gmail.com?subject=Say Hi">email</a>, I love feedback!

Notes on the site itself: 
One of the most effective learning methods for me is *learning by doing*. I am curious about design and coding, since front-end development serves as a creative outlet that also requires problem solving. 

This project has helped me learn about:

- **Static site generators**, like the one that powers this blog, [Hugo](gohugo.io). These allow me to serve these pages faster and more securely. This site lacks a backend that Wordpress sites have. Basically, I made this ten thousand more times complicated than I intially wanted because I did not want to pay (college!) for hosting a Wordpress site. I also wanted a bit more customization and challenge than setting up a Blogger/Wordpress.com/Tumblr (I still love Tumblr, though...) site. Once I get myself interested in something, I can't stop. 
- **HTML & CSS + templating**  - I found the theme [After Dark](https://github.com/comfusion/after-dark/), and then heavily modified it. I replaced all the CSS with a faster loading, more minimal framework: [min](http://mincss.com).
    - **How to design with code**- I haven't yet learned how to make actual apps or programs that do stuff, but I have learned a ton about layouts, the way the human eye reacts to visual design components, aesthetic design styles regarding typography, size, and color, and how to implement design concepts into a project using HTML and CSS. 
- **How to research** - This project required a lot of research and trial and error. There's a lot of great resources out there, and I am lucky for those developers who have written such great documentation! 
- **Patience** - This project kind of drove me crazy at times, but I tried to squeeze time here and there running around working and doing college stuff to work on it a little bit.

Thanks for visiting! I hope you find something you like here! :D
